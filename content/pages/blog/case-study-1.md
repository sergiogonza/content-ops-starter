At **Tax Defense Group USA**, we understand how overwhelming tax debt can be. Whether you're behind on your filings, facing penalties, or already in collections, our team is here to help you find real solutions.

### **What Is Tax Relief?**

Tax relief refers to a range of programs and options designed to help individuals and businesses resolve their outstanding tax issues with the IRS or state agencies. If you're dealing with wage garnishments, bank levies, liens, or mounting penalties, our specialists can help you take control through negotiation and resolution strategies tailored to your financial situation.



### **Tax Relief Services We Offer**

**‚úî Audit Representation**

Professional support to guide and defend you through an IRS audit.

**‚úî Innocent Spouse Relief**

We help remove tax liability unfairly assigned to you due to your spouse or ex-spouse.

**‚úî Payroll Tax Relief**

Solutions for employers behind on payroll tax obligations.

**‚úî Tax Lien Solutions**

Avoid or resolve liens with strategies such as:

*   Appealing the Lien

*   Lien Release

*   Lien Subordination

*   Credit Report Removal

*   Lien Avoidance

**‚úî Levy Protection**

Protection from or release of:

*   IRS Bank Levy

*   State Bank Levy

*   Wage Garnishment

*   Social Security Levy

*   Pension Levy



### **Tax Negotiation Programs**

**1. IRS Installment Agreement**

Set up a monthly payment plan if you can‚Äôt pay your full balance upfront. Required for individuals with debts over $25,000 and businesses over $10,000.

**2. Offer in Compromise (OIC)**

Settle your tax debt for less than you owe if you‚Äôre facing serious financial hardship. The IRS reviews:

*   Income & expenses

*   Assets

*   Ability to pay

**3. Currently Not Collectible (CNC) Status**

If you can‚Äôt pay anything due to extreme financial hardship, we can help you request CNC status. While penalties and interest may continue, the IRS suspends collections. If the 10-year collection window expires while under CNC, your debt may become permanently uncollectible.

**4. Penalty Abatement**

Remove or reduce IRS penalties if you qualify due to reasonable cause, clean compliance history, or other valid circumstances.

**5. Short-Term Extension**

Need extra time to pay your full balance? We can request a one-time extension of up to 120 days. Keep in mind, interest and a 0.5% monthly penalty will still apply.



### **Special Tax Relief Situations**

**üìç Disaster Relief**

If you've been affected by a natural disaster (hurricane, flood, fire, pandemic, earthquake), you may qualify for extensions and special relief programs.

**ü¶† COVID-19 Relief**

The IRS has implemented several temporary measures and support options for those impacted by the pandemic. We stay updated so you don‚Äôt miss out on available relief.
