      ## **Legal Disclaimer**


      Tax Defense Group USA is a private, independent tax resolution firm. We
      are not affiliated with, nor do we represent, the Internal Revenue Service
      (IRS) or any other government agency. We are also not a law firm and do
      not offer legal, accounting, or bankruptcy services.


      We do not guarantee specific outcomes regarding the reduction of tax debt
      or acceptance into IRS programs. Every case is unique, and results vary
      based on several factors, including the client’s cooperation, the accuracy
      of the information provided, and the specifics of each tax situation.
      Penalties and interest may continue to accrue until your tax liability is
      fully paid to the IRS.


      By using our services, you acknowledge and accept that we do not assume
      your tax debt, make payments on your behalf to any taxing authority or
      creditor, or act as a financial intermediary. Our role is to represent
      your interests before the IRS or applicable state tax agencies and work
      toward the most favorable resolution permitted by law.


      If you purchased our initial Tax Analysis Review, we offer a
      10-calendar-day money-back guarantee from the date of payment, provided
      that a Tax Resolution Agreement has not yet been signed. This guarantee
      applies only to the fee for the analysis service and does not apply to any
      fees under a Tax Resolution Agreement.


      By providing your contact information to us, you expressly consent to
      receive phone calls and/or text messages related to our services. These
      communications may include updates, promotions, and administrative
      notices. Standard messaging or data rates may apply depending on your
      service provider.


      Our services are subject to availability and may not be offered in all
      states. We strongly encourage you to review all program materials
      carefully before committing to any service.




      ## **Privacy Policy**


      At Tax Defense Group USA, your privacy is a top priority. When you
      interact with us—whether through our website, by phone, email, in person,
      or via affiliate partners—we collect certain information to deliver
      personalized and efficient services.


      We may collect two types of information: **personally identifiable
      information (PII)** and **non-personally identifiable information (NPI)**.


      PII includes data you voluntarily provide, such as your name, mailing
      address, email address, and phone number. In the course of providing our
      services, we may request additional details necessary for tax resolution,
      including tax records (e.g., tax returns, W-2s, 1099s), financial data
      (bank statements, retirement accounts, income and expense reports), and
      bookkeeping documentation relevant to your case.


      This information is used exclusively for operational purposes—to deliver
      the services you've requested. We do not sell, rent, or share your
      personal information with third parties, except as required to perform our
      services or as mandated by law. In situations where we must disclose your
      data to third parties, such as filing returns or communicating with tax
      authorities, we will request your prior, explicit consent. We fully comply
      with U.S. Treasury Regulation §301.7216, which governs the use of taxpayer
      information.


      We also collect NPI, such as IP addresses, pages visited, and referring
      URLs. This data is used anonymously to help us improve our website and
      analyze the effectiveness of our advertising. Tools such as Google
      Analytics may receive this information during your visit.


      We safeguard all collected data using industry-standard security
      protocols, both during transmission and while stored. Access to personal
      information is restricted to authorized employees or contractors operating
      under strict confidentiality agreements.


      Our website and services are intended for individuals over the age of 13.
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
      If we become aware that such data has been collected inadvertently, we
      will take immediate steps to delete it.
